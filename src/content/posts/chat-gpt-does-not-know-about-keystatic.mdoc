title: Chat gpt does not know about keystatic

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about a CMS (Content Management System) called "keytatic." It's possible that developments or new software have occurred since then, and I may not be aware of them.

If "keytatic" is a relatively recent or niche CMS, I recommend checking the official website, documentation, or any reputable sources related to web development and CMS software for the most up-to-date and accurate information. You may also consider searching online forums, community discussions, or social media groups where users might share their experiences with this CMS.

Remember to verify the information from reliable sources to ensure accuracy and relevance to your specific needs.
